# TFG Modern Documentation (Shelfmade Tweaks)

Welcome to the documentation for TFG Modern-Shelfmade. This is my own take on a
Terrafirmacraft + GregTech modpack, built upon the existing (and awesome!) work
on TerrafirmaGreg. It follows the original vision of a hyperrealistic modpack
but includes fun, believable tweaks for my own entertainment. The reason? I want
to have fun while doing chores.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.20.1 - PrismLauncher recommended
- Java 17+ - See [Java Section](installing/java) for installation instructions
  if stuck

## Installation

[prepare the pack themselves]: https://juraj-hrivnak.github.io/Pakku/exporting-a-modpack.html
[GitHub Releases]: https://github.com/Shelfmd/TFG-Modern/releases

The pack itself is constructed with Pakku, following `pakku.json` and
`pakku-lock.json` in the repository root. While more advanced users might choose
to [prepare the pack themselves], pre-built releases for client and server usage
will be made available under GitHub Releases.

### Downloading from Latest Release

1. Download the latest release from the [Github Releases] page.
2. Unpack or import the pack
   - The automated releases contain exports for CurseForge, which can be
     imported by some launchers. If stuck, please consider using PrismLauncher
     as it is able to import our pack format without any hassle.

### Usage

Create an instance on your launcher, or manually place mods & client
configuration in your Minecraft instance. Once you're done, launch the game and
pick "Multiplayer" on the main menu. Then, hit "Add Server" and enter the
`ip:port` (in the same line) or the domain pointing at the server.

- See the generated [Mod List](docs/mod-list.md) for a full list of included
  mods.
- For introductions to key mods, see [Mod Introductions](mod-introductions.md).
