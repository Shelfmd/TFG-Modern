## Survival Modpack as It Should've Been
*(Do we want to keep this tagline? it's a reference to TFC's, but it feels a little too pompous I think?)*

**TerraFirmaGreg-Modern** is a Forge modpack that redefines Minecraft survival
by introducing realistic challenges alongside advanced technological mechanics.
In this modpack, you will be put to the task of taking control of untouched
wilderness and turning it to an industrial wonderland. Start from humble
beginning picking up rocks, and end while traversing interstellar space (coming
soon)! The heart of the modpack is formed by two standout mods:

- **[TerraFirmaCraft]** - Renowned for its immersive survival mechanics and a
  unique, challenging approach.
- **[GregTech Modern]** - A pinnacle of technical mods that brings deep, complex
  machinery and automation into the mix.

In addition to these core mods, TerraFirmaGreg-Modern includes several other
compelling additions that enrich gameplay further:

- **[Applied Energistics]** – Cutting-edge storage and automation systems.
- **[Create]** – Innovative machinery and kinetic contraptions.

Several hand-picked TFC and Create addons to provide even more depth. Many other
small mods tie everything together, and the modpack also integrates quests to
help you navigate its complex world.

### Personal Additions

[live documentation]: https://shelfmd.github.io/TFG-Modern

This repository houses my _personal_ build of TerrafirmaGreg-Modern. It is
designed to be used on my private server, and as such it includes my own
personal selection of mods. Some of those decisions, additions, or other changes
will be documented in the [live documentation].

I have elected to soft-fork the TerrafirmaGreg-Modern repository, as GitHub
imposes absurd CI restrictions to forks of repositories. I do not claim
authorship of this modpack, nor the mods and configurations in it unless
explicitly stated. See [LICENSE](../LICENSE) for details of licensing.
